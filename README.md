# file-organizer

This script has been written to clean up my (really) messy folders (Downloads folder to be precise) with files having all sorts of extensions. It organizes files by creating folders for each extension and then segregating the files accordingly. 

All individual extension folders are collected in a new folder named 'Auto-Organized' followed by date and time at that instance.
Example name of folder after organizing : 'Auto-Organized-2024-01-30 09:23:57'


Usage
-------
Keep the file organizer.py in the folder to organize and call the following:

For organizing:   python3 organizer.py

For unorganizng (i.e. undo the last organize command):  python3 organizer.py -u
